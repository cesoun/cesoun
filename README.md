`Preferred`
1. Go
2. JavaScript/TypeScript
3. Java

`Want to use more of`
1. Python
2. Rust
3. C/C++
4. Kotlin
5. C#

## Cloud Platforms
I have also explored quite a bit of the cloud during my professional, educational and personal expereince. My primary platforms are typically
`AWS` and `DigitalOcean` for most of my personal projects and most my knowledge lies.

I do know my way around `Azure`, `GCloud` and `Heroku`.

## Other things
There are quite a few other technologies, frameworks & libraries so I'll try and list them here in a *somewhat* neat fashion.

- Angular
- Chai, Confluence
- Docker
- Gradle, GraphQL
- Jest, Jira
- Maven, Mocha
- NoSQL, NodeJS, npm
